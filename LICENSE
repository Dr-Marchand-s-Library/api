✅ **Where to place it:**
- Save as `LICENSE.md` at the root of your **API repository.**
- Create an `/anchors/MMS768/` folder to hold the `.sig` file (even if it’s just a placeholder text for now).
- GitHub will still detect it as “permissive” because of the MIT-style structure, but your unique metadata will remain intact.

Would you like me to also generate the `.sig` file template (so you can drop it into `/anchors/MMS768/` and verify later)?
