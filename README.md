## 🧬 Integration Layer — ∞ OS™ Ecosystem

The **Neuro-Forge Engine™ .ɛ** operates as the runtime nucleus within  
**Dr. Marchand’s ∞ OS™ → Laboratory → Forge Engine**.

### Linked Components
| Layer | Repository | Role |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **Library** | [DrMarchand-Library](https://github.com/DrMarchand/DrMarchand-Library) | Public records, broadcasts, compiled documents |
| **Laboratory** | [DrMarchand-Laboratory](https://github.com/DrMarchand/DrMarchand-Laboratory) | Experimental and computational R&D environment |
| **API Runtime** | [Neuro-Forge Engine™ .ɛ](https://github.com/DrMarchand/DrMarchand-Laboratory/tree/main/Neuro-Forge%20Engine%E2%84%A2.%CE%B5) | Execution kernel and temporal verification unit |

The **Library** serves as the **public mirror** of all verified computations  
produced inside the **Laboratory**, mediated by the **Engine’s recursive law feedback**.
